# LinAlgApps
Repository to demonstrate some applications of computational linear algebra using Julia

## Topics
Topics include low rank approximation of images, image segmentation, image denoiseing and more.  

### Low Rank Approximation
To determine a low rank approximation we must first determine the 
singular value decomposition.

So the SVD is A =
